# 3D Book Maker
This is a utility built to take flat images of books and generate them in 3D. Currently, hardcover, perfect bound, and saddlestitched books can be generated. The utility can be found at [kinetikeith.github.io/book-maker](https://kinetikeith.github.io/book-maker/).
## Options
When the utility is opened a placeholder book will be generated. You can adjust the book type, insert the needed cover files, and adjust the scaling. If the book is hardcover you can also choose the color of the inside wrap on the back cover. The "Download Image" option allows you to download the file directly to your computer as a png. Copy image copies the png to your clipboard for use in other programs.
The utility accepts pngs, jpegs, and psds (psd implementation is kinda jank though so watch out)
### Perfect Bound
To generate a perfect bound book, insert your cover and spine files and wait for you image to fully generate.
### Hardcover
To generate a hardcover book, insert your cover and spine files and pick the color for the back cover wrap, then wait for you image to fully generate.
### Saddlestitch
To generate a saddlestitched book, insert your cover file and wait for you image to fully generate.
