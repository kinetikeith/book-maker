# 3D Book Maker
This is a utility built to take flat images of books and generate them in 3D. Currently, hardcover, perfect bound, and saddlestitched books can be generated. The utility can be found at [kinetikeith.github.io/book-maker](https://kinetikeith.github.io/book-maker/).
## Options
When the utility is opened a placeholder book will be generated. You can adjust the book type, insert the needed cover files, and adjust the scaling. If the book is hardcover you can also choose the color of the inside wrap on the back cover. The "Download Image" option allows you to download the file directly to your computer as a png. Copy image copies the png to your clipboard for use in other programs.
The utility accepts pngs, jpegs, and psds (psd implementation is kinda jank though so watch out)
